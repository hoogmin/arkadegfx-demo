# ArkadeGFX - Demo Site

This a demo site for a fictional small business called
ArkadeGFX (doesn't exist at time of writing). I wanted to build this to sharpen my front-end
skills. It uses React, Next, and Tailwind primarily. I would say it was inspired by [SwankyBox's](https://www.youtube.com/@SwankyBox) website,
a pretty cool youtuber and [Flynn's Arcade & More](https://flynnsgaming.com/), a retro arcade. I opted to use JavaScript instead of TypeScript
for this one as I am questioning the usefulness of the latter right now.
